        <h1>Chicken</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, 
            originally from India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
            Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. 
            A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. 
            Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, 
            they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, 
            and for eggs, they are layers.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.
